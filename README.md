StoryGenerator
Overview (Обзор)
StoryGenerator is a simple RPG story generator designed to create engaging narratives composed of events and decisions. As the game evolves, both the types of events and the breadth of decisions available to the player will expand. The game will also feature increasingly complex character parameters for those involved in the story.

Primary Objective (Основная цель)
The primary goal of this game-program is to facilitate such easy extensibility of decisions, situations, creatures, and more, that it becomes feasible to use neural networks for expanding and enhancing the game experience.
